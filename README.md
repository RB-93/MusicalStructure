# MusicalStructure

## Project name: Surmayi[^](https://github.com/RB-93/MusicalStructure/blob/master/README.md#legends)

## Description:

This project was created as a part of the Android Basics Nanodegree and for Google India Scholarship Challenge 2k18. The goal of this project is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
* In this project, I have build an app to play music from the user’s library of music.

## Challenges:

* I faced an issue of large APK/file size, which is a bad impression towards an app enviroment and memory footprint. It was due to MBs of media files and high quality images from different soures.
* The app work flow lagged and/or issued ANR (stopped responding)

## Solution:

* I have referred and utilized some good sources to compress pictures and media files as mentioned in [Credits](https://github.com/RB-93/MusicalStructure/blob/master/README.md#credits) section.
